# Semantic UI Testbed

-----------

## Background
I want to have a web page where users upload data, I process it in the background, and return the processed data.  
Unfortunately the processing takes a bit of time (a few minutes), and it's unfortunate that the end user has to just sit there, unsure whether something has crashed..

Looking at Tailwind, Bootstrap, Bulma, etc, I can see a lot of options available for me, but semantic-ui seems to have everything I want (?)

## Lessons learnt
- **Forcing myself to write down the 'plan of attack'** seems helpful up front, my development process could be described as 'interrupted', and I feel better about the idea that future me can pick things up.
- Adding the links seemed useful initially, I've just been doing a bit of initial research, and didn't want that to go to waste when I closed my web browser. But I think my implementation may have been... naive. It really interrupts the flow of the to do list, making it hard to tell at a glance what's happening.
  - Moving it to a **table makes it much easier to read** when rendered. It's a pain in markdown.
- This is my first time working entirely from VS Code. `Control ~` opens the terminal window and let me `python -m venv venv`, so I didn't need to have a separate command prompt open. ~~~Wish me luck with the git push, without having actually set it up in github prior~~~ - It worked great!.
