1. Never trust CodePen/JSFiddle
   * I take that back, on the LHS of JSFiddle it has "Resources", which actually spells out the .js code used
     * https://jsfiddle.net/api/post/library/pure/
   * Codepen you need to go to Settings > JS > Add External Scripts/Pens
     * https://codepen.io/pen
2. Always just right click > inspect the actual demo page
   * https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/examples/network/data/dotLanguage/dotEdgeStyles.html
